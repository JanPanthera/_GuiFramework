# GuiFramework

GuiFramework is a powerful and user-friendly library for building UI applications in Python 3.12. Designed with simplicity and efficiency in mind, it leverages the `customtkinter` library to provide an enhanced experience for developers looking to create intuitive and dynamic interfaces.

## Features

- **Window Class**: A convenient wrapper around `customtkinter`'s CTk class, simplifying the creation and setup of windows for your applications.
- **Config Manager**: Utilizes Python's built-in config library for easy reading and writing of settings to a config file. It includes support for application-wide variables, enabling seamless access and modification across your project.
- **Custom Type Registration**: Allows for the registration of custom types (e.g., a Matrix class) with functions to convert these types to and from strings. This feature facilitates the straightforward persistence of custom data types in configuration files.
- **GUI Manager**: Empowers developers to define GUI layouts using JSON, significantly reducing the amount of code required in your GUI components. The GUI Manager handles the instantiation and organization of `customtkinter` and `tkinter` widgets based on your JSON definitions.
